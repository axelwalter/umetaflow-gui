# User Guide

Welcome to the OpenMS Streamlit Web Application! This guide will help you understand how to use our tools effectively.

## Advantages of OpenMS Web Apps

OpenMS web applications provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the powerful features of OpenMS. Here are a few advantages:
- **Accessibility**: Access powerful OpenMS algorithms and TOPP tools from any device with a web browser.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified user interface makes it easy for both beginners and experts to perform complex analyses.
- **No Installation Required**: Use the tools without the need to install OpenMS locally, saving time and system resources.

## Workspaces

In the OpenMS web application, workspaces are designed to keep your analysis organized:
- **Workspace Specific Parameters and Files**: Each workspace stores parameters and files (uploaded input files and results from workflows).
- **Persistence**: Your workspaces and parameters are saved, so you can return to your analysis anytime and pick up where you left off.

## Online and Local Mode Differences

There are a few key differences between operating in online and local modes:
- **File Uploads**:
  - *Online Mode*: You can upload only one file at a time. This helps manage server load and optimizes performance.
  - *Local Mode*: Multiple file uploads are supported, giving you flexibility when working with large datasets.
- **Workspace Access**:
  - In online mode, workspaces are stored temporarily and will be cleared after seven days of inactivity.
  - In local mode, workspaces are saved on your local machine, allowing for persistent storage.

## Downloading Results

You can download the results of your analyses, including figures and tables, directly from the application:
- **Figures**: Click the camera icon button, appearing while hovering on the top right corner of the figure. Set the desired image format in the settings panel in the side bar.
- **Tables**: Use the download button next to displayed tables to save them as CSV files.

To get started:
1. Select or create a new workspace.
2. Upload your data file.
3. Set the necessary parameters for your analysis.
4. Run the analysis.
